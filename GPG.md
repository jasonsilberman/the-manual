# GPG Keys

This is a doc on how to sign commits with GPG. Look at the following links:

1. https://help.github.com/articles/signing-commits-with-gpg/
2. https://stackoverflow.com/a/47087248/1740273
3. https://stackoverflow.com/a/44303808/1740273 (`killall gpg-agent` and then `gpg-agent --daemon`)

There should be actual instructions here on how to actually do this.
