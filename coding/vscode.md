# Visual Studio Code

## Error about decorators with ESLint
This comment helped me fix the issue.
```
I am in angular and vs code but I fixed it by going to:
preferences -> settings
in the search field type: javascript.implicit

You will see an option to enable/disable experimentalDecorators for Javascript files... check it and save the settings file

All done.
```
