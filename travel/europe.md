# Travel Tips For Europe

## Restaurants
- Free cold water is very hard to come by. If at a resturant you can ask for "tap water for the table," but this will not have ice most likely. Also, good luck getting re-fills.
- You don't need to tip wait staff.

## Money
- If you have a BofA debit card, you can go to any BNP or Barclays ATM and withdraw free of charge.
- Very few places take Discover card, make sure you have a VISA or MasterCard.
- Make sure your credit card has no foreign transaction fees.
- Try to see if you can setup a PIN on your credit card for use at vending machines (and at McDonalds).
- If you are going to buy something from a street vendor, make sure you bargain them down. If they say something is €25 you can often get them down to €10 or even €5. Just seem interested but hesitant to purchase and they will lower the price.
- Tax is included in the price of most goods.

## Adapters
Different parts of Europe have different adapters. Even the countries that use the `<•  •>` style plugs differ on how they ground them. Here is a helpful chart:

Most of the `C`, `E`, `F` plugs will work interchangably for non grounded plugs.
